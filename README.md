RoboIME Artificial Intelligence
===============================

This project aims to provide a set of software to take full control of the
robots on an autonomous match, and to aid its development by providing
facilities such as a Simulation environment.


Requirements
------------

- Git (if you intend to contribute)
- CMake
- Qt5 (core, widgets, network and opengl)
- Google Protobuf
- Google Test (read [tests readme](tests/README.md) for more details.

On Ubuntu 13.04 the following should suffice:

    apt-get install git cmake ubuntu-sdk protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev

You're recommended to use QtCreator, but not mandatory, use your preferred IDE,
or no IDE at all, plain vim, make and gdb will do just fine.

TODO: add packages for other distros
